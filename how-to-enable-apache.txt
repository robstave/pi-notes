To stop a service doesn't prevent the deamon to start the service on boot. 
For this you should deactivate the service to come up on all run levels

A simple command for this on raspbian is 

update-rc.d apache2 disable 

If you later want the webserver starts again on default just type  

update-rc.d apache2 enable'

With the comand sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start you bring up the web server on demand.
